# What is a web service ??
# When a developer wants to share the functionality of a function but not the actual code in the program, they can place the function on a web server. 
# A programmer with the address of that function on the web server and the required permissions can call the function.
# This is called a web service


# What is an API
# You can't call a function unless you know the function name and the required parameters
# When you create a web service you create an Application Programming Interface (API)
# The API defines the function names and parameters so others know how to call your function.

# Keys allow me to track which users have permission to use my web service
# A developer signs up on my web site, or buys a license for my software and is provided a unique key
# When the developer calls my web service they provide their unique key and I am able to verify the key has been approved for calls to my web service.
